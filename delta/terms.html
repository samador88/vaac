                        govern.

                            <li><strong><u>a.   Mandatory Arbitration.</u></strong>   Please read this carefully.  It affects your rights.  YOU AND VAACARMY AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration
                                <ol class="no-style"> 
                                    <li><strong><u>i.   Commencing Arbitration</u></strong>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “<strong><u>Notice</u></strong>”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to VAACARMY, to you via any other method available to VAACARMY, including via email.  The Notice to VAACARMY should be addressed to VAACARMY, LLC, 4010 Long Champ Dr. #7, Austin, TX 78746 (the “<strong><u>Arbitration Notice Address</u></strong>”).  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the “<strong><u>Demand</u></strong>”).  If you and VAACARMY do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or VAACARMY may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court.  THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“<strong><u>AAA</u></strong>”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE “<strong><u>Rules</u></strong>”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS EULA.  The Rules and AAA forms are available online at www.adr.org.

                                    </strong>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.  A single independent and impartial arbitrator shall be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein.  You and VAACARMY agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.

Decision of the Arbitrator.  </u></strong>Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator shall issue his or her decision within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.  The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional thirty (30) days in the interests of justice.  All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.  The award of the arbitrator shall be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.  The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of Texas in conducting the arbitration.  You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.  The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in this EULA.

You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this EULA by VAACARMY or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against VAACARMY, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this EULA.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li><strong><u>c.   Claims.  </u></strong>You and VAACARMY agree that, notwithstanding any other rights the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.  Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution section will be considered improperly filed.  Should you file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution section, VAACARMY may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to $5,000, provided that VAACARMY has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li><strong><u>e.   Modifications.  </u></strong>In the event that VAACARMY makes any future change to the Mandatory Arbitration provision (other than a change to VAACARMY’s Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to VAACARMY’s Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with VAACARMY and your license to use the Service shall terminate immediately, and this Dispute Resolution provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive the termination of this EULA.
                            </li><br/>
                            <li><strong><u>f.   Enforceability.  </u></strong>If only Section 15.a.iii or the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 shall govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.
